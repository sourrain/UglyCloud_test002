# UglyCloud_test002
_Watching clouds in the sky and guessing the shape of it is the most chill game we experienced before.The Ugly Cloud provided a peaceful way to present a possibitlity for peoples to argument some serious issues under this beautiful view._

## Step1. Clouds Scene
_procedural, 3d, raymarching, volumetric, lod, vr_
>
using an iconic [clouds shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XslGRr) by iq , and custumize a run-time noise texture to becsuitable in Unity .algorithm : [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sfGzS).

2.Script:RuntimeTextureGenerator
>
## Step2. A MatCap Cloud _The overlay effect achieved by the shader provides the lighting style
_A MatCap is a 2D texture representing a 3D surface that includes lighting and reflections. As such, it doesn't require light and can drastically reduce CPU and GPU overhead. It simply overlays/projects the texture selected onto the mesh with the help of the mesh's normals._

2.format:Custume render texture
>
_custom light probes. Each probe is a sphere with a texture with an orthographic camera attached. The orthographic camera is positioned in such a way that it captures the lighting probe at the proper proportions to be saved as a render texture that mimics a MatCap texture_
>
## Step3. Lighting and Fog
Tip: to get your particles to light properly
>
take the Normal Direction setting in the render drop-down to 0, or 0.05. This will bend the particle normals into a hemispherical shape
>Camera Setting: envirnment/skybox

## Step4. Making C4d Model of cloud
>

>
model from C4D to unity:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGhI948mMQE
>
1.After downloading free 3D Modeling from online library, need to turn several object children into one single model.
>
>(right click)Select Children/(right click)Connect objects+Delete
>
2.Making enough Segments
>
>add Subdivisions Surface>(click on C)>take object out and thats it! 
>
3.Making animation by set the Dispacer>shader>Animation to speed 1
>
4.Export FBX Model and Animation

>
Use C4d: Polygon Reduction to make Level of Detail – LOD 
>
go to C4d Animation template/drag the object into Timeline/Function/Bake

## Step5. Sound Control and Design
>
>public class SoundController : MonoBehaviour
>
>{
>
>public AudioSource goodSound;
>
>public AudioSource badSound;
>
>// Start is called before the first frame update
>
> void Start(){
>
>badSound.Pause();
>
>}
>
>   // Update is called once per frame
>    void Update()
> 
>{
>       if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
>       {
>           goodSound.Pause();
>           badSound.Play();
>       }
>
>       if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.Space))
>       {
>           goodSound.Play();
>           badSound.Pause();
> }
>
>}
